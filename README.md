# Insurance Cost Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict insurance costs using a linear regression model. By leveraging Python and its powerful data science libraries, we import and analyze the data, preprocess it, and then build and evaluate a predictive model.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection & Analysis:** Load and explore the insurance dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Use plots to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Preprocessing:** Encode categorical variables and split data into features and target variables.
- **Model Training:** Train a linear regression model to predict insurance costs.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared.

## Components
- Python libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis and model building.

## How It Works
1. **Import Dependencies:** Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Data Collection & Analysis:** Load the insurance dataset and explore its structure, including checking for missing values and basic statistical measures.
3. **Data Visualization:** Plot various features like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region to understand their distributions and relationships.
4. **Data Preprocessing:** Encode categorical variables (e.g., sex, smoker, region) into numerical values. Split the data into features (X) and target variable (Y).
5. **Train-Test Split:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. **Model Training:** Train a linear regression model on the training data.
7. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on both training and testing data using the R-squared metric.
8. **Predictive System:** Build a system to predict insurance costs for new data inputs.

## Applications
- Predict insurance costs based on individual attributes.
- Understand factors that influence insurance costs.
